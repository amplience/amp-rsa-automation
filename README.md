### content

The root folder for automation content is `content`.  Let's dig in to what's inside there.
- `content-type-schemas`

    Schemas are your data models for your experiences.

    [Content type schemas](https://amplience.com/docs/integration/contenttypes.html)

- `content-types`

    Content Types define where and how youd schemas can be used and attibutes for business teams.

    [Content types](https://amplience.com/docs/glossary.html#content-type)

- `content-items`

    At the root level of `content-items` there are folders that represent specific repositories.  These folders can hold both content items (`*.json.hbs`) and folders.

- `extensions`

    Web apps that extend the functionality of Dynamic Content.  [Extensions](https://amplience.com/docs/development/extensions.html)

- `indexes`

    Indexes used with Amplience Search.  [Search Indexes](https://amplience.com/docs/development/search-indexes/readme.html)

- `settings`

    Hub settings including [workflow states](https://amplience.com/docs/production/workflow.html#workflow) and [visualization settings](https://amplience.com/docs/production/visualizations.html#visualizations)

## Handlebars template substitution

Files that end in `.hbs` are Handlebars templates, and can use the context that `amprsa` passes in to it. Here are several examples of templated variables used:

- `dam.imagesMap.<key>`

    where `key` is a camel-cased reference to an asset in dam

- `contentMap.<key>`

    where `key` is a slugified version of the content item's delivery key

- `cms.repositories.<key>`

    where `key` is a slugified version of the repository name

- `url`

    the application deployment URL (for visualizations)

- `cms.hub.name`

    hub name
